# Psychrometric Chart Generator

This Python script generates a psychrometric chart, a graphical representation of the thermodynamic properties of moist air. It uses the `psychrolib` library to calculate various air properties and visualize them on a chart. The chart includes saturation lines, relative humidity lines, enthalpy lines, wet-bulb temperature lines, and specific volume lines, helping users understand and analyze air conditioning, HVAC, and thermodynamics systems.

To study more about the usage of Psychrometric Chart, We have created the psychrometric Calculator - [Online Psychrometric Calculator for Chemical Engineers](https://chemenggcalc.com/psychrometric-calculator-chemical-engineer/)

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy` for numerical calculations.
- `matplotlib` for plotting the chart.
- `psychrolib` for psychrometric calculations.

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib psychrolib
