# Psychrometric Chart Generator

This Python script generates a psychrometric chart, a graphical representation of the thermodynamic properties of moist air. It uses the `psychrolib` library to calculate various air properties and visualize them on a chart. The chart includes saturation lines, relative humidity lines, enthalpy lines, wet-bulb temperature lines, and specific volume lines, helping users understand and analyze air conditioning, HVAC, and thermodynamics systems.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy` for numerical calculations.
- `matplotlib` for plotting the chart.
- `psychrolib` for psychrometric calculations.

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib psychrolib
